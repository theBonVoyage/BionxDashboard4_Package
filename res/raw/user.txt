The Dashboard Grid is the main user interface of the Bionx Dashbaord. As the any user can see,
this section is comprised of grid like panels, an ActionBar, and misc information about the user's device. There
are currently 4 panels to click on. Bionx, Phandroid, XDA, and Google. If a user clicks on Bionx, This panel 
takes the user to a webview that automatically brings up the Bionx Website where the user can locate helpfull information
for themselfs and contact the developer directly. The XDA and Phandroid panels take the user straight to the community
based websites through their web browser. The Google panel takes the user to Biotic's Google Play account and 
shows off the current applications Biotic is working on and selling. Dont be affraid to take a peek! Below the 
panels, Information about your device reside here.

--Dashboard Menu--
The Dashboard Menu provides users with 7 options. Bions Tools is a list of helpfull tools and Root enabled tools
to either assist you in acomplishing a task or doing a small mod on your system. Nx Performance is strictly for Rooted
Users and more information about this menu resides below. Catalyst Rom menu is strictly for Catalyst Rom users! Any
options in this menu more than likely wont work for you as a user because these options are to toggle integrated
mods in the Catalyst Rom for the Droid Razr. Nx Power is sctrictly for Rooted users as it contains a power menu
for users to easily reboot their device to whatever preference they like. Manual is well...You made it here so

and see what changes we have made since the beginning. The Dismiss option will simply exit the user from the application.
