Bionx Dashboard 4 starts the R2 rollout for Bionx Catalyst users. Not only am I starting a new ground point but starting to phase myself into the AOKP injection process. Future Bionx Roms will be AOKP based and BD4 shows that by being powered by some of the most powerfull tools by the AOKP Team.

BD 4 has many usefull tools that have been upgraded to work on many other roms as well. This Toolkit has been completely rebuilt from the ground up to support a multitude of users.

This software is free to distribute and modify but under one circumstance. Only if I can get in some of the dirt! AOSP is a community project and a free of charge use of software and free paying job. We do it to improve the android experience and to compete with other devs to bring our imagination to reality.
